A game where you traverse a 'maze' from one end to the other. Can you make it through without dying? Test your fighting and navigation skills below. 
<br>
>>>> This game shows off the 4 pillars of OOP. Each character has their own special attack on top of a standard attack or defend. Each Character has their own stats such as health and ability to block an attack. Abstaction is used to keep the game simple all while your moves and stats are being tracked. Polymorphism is being used as there are multiple heroes and foes. Inheritance is used as there are Characters Objects who can be bad or good and so on. Encapsulations is used as there are many classes to define the Characters and parts of the game. Interfaces and abstract classes are used here as well.

<br>
TO START:
<br>
1. Download and extract the Zip File <br>
2. Open Eclipse or IntelliJ and open the "The-Dungeon-Main" folder in the IDE<br>
3. If your set up process is like mine, create a package that is named "dungeon" (or simply rename the default package to dungeon). Transfer the compilable files (Java classes with SOLID fill J) to the dungeon package.<br>
4. Run the DungeonAdventure.Java class. (proceed with errors)<br>
5. Play the game, until you escape or die! :D<br>
