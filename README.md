# The-Dungeon
A game where you traverse a 'maze' from one end to the other. Can you make it through without dying?
<br>
>>>> This game shows off the 4 pillars of OOP. 
<br>
<br>
TO START:
<br>
1. Download and extract the Zip File <br>
2. Open Eclipse or IntelliJ and open the "The-Dungeon-Main" folder in the IDE<br>
3. If your set up process is like mine, create a package that is named "dungeon" (or simply rename the default package to dungeon). Transfer the compilable files (Java classes with SOLID fill J) to the dungeon package.<br>
4. Run the DungeonAdventure.Java class. (proceed with errors)<br>
5. Play the game! :D<br>
<br>
<br>
"WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON ADVENTURE WHERE YOU MUST FIND ALL FOUR OO PILLARS AND THE EXIT.<br>
TO MOVE USE KEYS N,S,E,W AND TO USE POTIONS PRESS P DURING EXPLORING OR <br>
3 DURING BATTLE, IT WILL NOT COUNT AS A TURN DURING ATTACKS, GOOD LUCK!"<br>
